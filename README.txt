  HERO OF LIGHT
    by Asel Gamage

This is side scrolling, fantasy, RPG-styled game with a story arc, numerous levels, and intense boss fights

One of my top priorities when creating this game was making the player's movement unique, satisfying, and
advanced. To do this, I put a large emphasis on using vertical movement to dodge enemy attacks, and get around the
maps. I implemented a double jump feature, alongside a somersault which you can do by double jumping while running.
Somersaults give a burst of horizontal momentum allowing you to dodge and bait enemy attacks effectively after
sufficient practises.

Another focus was making a skillful combat system with different ways to play. Using the airAttack sequence allows
you to get high ground on opponents and come crashing down on the last attack to deal large chunks of damage, while
attacking from the ground gives you more mobility options (player can lunge after each attack by holding movement
keys during attack sequence.

To create and develop a story within a game, I needed a dialogue system which was completely seperated from the data
so I could use it in multiple levels, and adaptable to the different use cases (for example, leaving text on screen
until some action happens or waiting for an event to trigger a dialogue box).

I also wanted the game to look attractive and have very unique maps that played around the players movement abilities
I spent a lot of time making each custom map and adding small details to make each level interesting and appealing
to the eye.

Any fantasy RPG-style game needs some sort of magic, so I added two spells/abilities to my game. Abilities are
unlocked by playing through levels 2 and 3.

Overall, I believe my game is fun to play, with an interesting story which is continued through each level.
Hope you enjoy!
